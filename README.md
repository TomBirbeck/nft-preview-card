## My process

I began by setting the box-sizing to border-box and the padding and margin to 0. I then created the custom variables for the colours and imported the correct font and weights.\
I then planned out how what I would need to do to get the correct layout. I built up the HTML frame and added the styling needed for the base card state.\
Finally I added the active states where needed, including the overlay for the picture, and a box-shadow to make the card "pop".

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

This challenge was good for learning about adding an overlay to images.

### Useful resources

- [w3docs](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/css/how-to-overlay-images-with-css.html) - This helped me with adding the image overlay effect on hover.
